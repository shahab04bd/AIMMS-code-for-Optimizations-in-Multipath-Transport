Warning: The rows "subflow_iden_5(g,h,a,b,a,b,a,c)" and "subflow_iden_5(g,h,a,b,a,c,a,b)" are equal in the generated mathematical program "max_min". 
This may lead to non-unique shadow prices.

AIMMS presolve changed 1420 column bounds and eliminated 5292 rows and 1300 columns.
The presolved model contains only linear constraints and therefore the model type was changed into MIP.
AIMMS presolve time = 0.24 sec.
